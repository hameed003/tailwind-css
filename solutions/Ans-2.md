Great catch! Let‚Äôs clear that up. üöÄ

In the first example, when you **don‚Äôt use `extend`**, the entire `colors` object is **replaced** with whatever you define. So if you only define:

```javascript
tailwind.config = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      mycolor: "#da373d",
    },
  },
};
```

‚û°Ô∏è **What happens:**

- **Only** `mycolor` exists.
- **All other colors (including `white`) are removed**.

So, this:

```html
<div class="bg-mycolor text-white">Custom Color!</div>
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Won't work** for `text-white`, because **white is part of Tailwind‚Äôs default color palette**, which got overridden.

### üü† **Correct way to keep white:**

If you **really** want to replace colors but keep `white`, you need to manually include it:

```javascript
tailwind.config = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      mycolor: "#da373d",
      white: "#ffffff", // Add white back manually
    },
  },
};
```

Now this will work:

```html
<div class="bg-mycolor text-white">Custom Color!</div>
```

### ‚úÖ **Why `extend` is better:**

If you use `extend`, Tailwind **automatically keeps** all the default colors, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about adding them back manually.
